# DecentralBrain
DecentralBrain is Kahoot-like quiz game on blockchain that provides you to create your quiz contracts and share it with your friends.

## Problem

- DecentralBrain has a difference you can create your quiz contract and invite your friends with contract’s address but players should pay an entryfee.In the end the player with the highest score receives the entire prize.

- Normally building like these applications is difficult because of the centralized payment system but on blockchain it is possible , easy and reliable 

- So I built a react application works on Sepolia testnet(for now)  and for backend I built quizContracts and Factorys

## Technologies,Frameworks that I used to build

- ReactJS

- Vite

- ChakraUI

- Hardhat

- Solidity
